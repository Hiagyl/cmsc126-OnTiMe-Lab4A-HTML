                <p>The Great Pyramid, located at Giza on the west bank of the Nile River north of Cairo in Egypt, is the
                    only wonder of the
                    ancient world that has survived to the present day. It is part of a group of three pyramids-Khufu
                    (Cheops), Khafra
                    (Chephren) and Menkaura (Mycerimus)-that were built between 2700 B.C. and 2500 B.C. as royal tombs.
                    The largest and most
                    impressive is Khufu, known as “The Great Pyramid,” which covers 13 acres and is believed to contain
                    more than 2 million
                    stone blocks that weigh from two to 30 tons each.

                <p>The Colossus of Rhodes was an enormous bronze sculpture of the sun god Helios built by the Rhodians
                    over 12 years in the
                    third century B.C. The city was the target of a Macedonian siege early in the fourth century B.C.
                    and, according to
                    legend, the Rhodians sold the tools and equipment left behind by the Macedonians to pay for the
                    Colossus. Designed by
                    the sculptor Chares, the statue was, at 100 feet, the tallest of the ancient world. It was completed
                    around 280 B.C. and
                    stood for sixty years until it was toppled in an earthquake. It was never rebuilt.

                <p>The Lighthouse of Alexandria was located on a small island called Pharos near the city of Alexandria.
                    Designed by the
                    Greek architect Sostratos and completed around 270 B.C. during the reign of Ptolemy II, the
                    lighthouse helped to guide
                    Nile River ships in and out of the city's busy harbor.

                <p>Located in what is now southeastern Turkey, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was a tomb built by
                    Artemisia for her
                    husband, Mausolus, the king of Carnia in Asia Minor, after his death in 353 B.C. Mausolus was also
                    Artemisia's brother,
                    and, according to legend, she was so grief-stricken at his passing that she mixed his ashes with
                    water and drank them in
                    addition to ordering the mausoleum's construction. The massive mausoleum was made entirely of white
                    marble and is
                    thought to have been about 135 feet high.

                <p>There was actually more than one Temple of Artemis: A series of several altars and temples was
                    destroyed and then
                    restored on the same site in Ephesus, a Greek port city on the west coast of modern-day Turkey. The
                    most fabulous of
                    these structures were two marble temples built around 550 B.C. and 350 B.C., respectively. “Apart
                    from Olympus, the Sun
                    never looked on anything so grand,” the writer Antipater of Sidon wrote of the Temple of Artemis at
                    Ephesus.

                <p>The famed statue of Zeus, the king of the gods in Greek Mythology, was crafted by the Athenian
                    sculptor Phidias and
                    completed and placed in the temple of Zeus at Olympia, site of the ancient Olympics, around the
                    mid-fifth century B.C.
                    The statue depicted the god of thunder seated bare-chested at a wooden throne. Holding up the
                    thrones' armrests were two
                    carved sphinxes, mythical creatures with the head and chest of a woman, the body of lion and the
                    wings of a bird. The
                    statue of Zeus was richly decorated with gold and ivory.

                </figure>
                <p>According to ancient Greek poets, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were built near the Euphrates River
                    in modern-day Iraq
                    by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II around 600 B.C. The gardens were said to have been planted
                    as high as 75 feet
                    in the air on a huge square brick terrace that was laid out in steps like a theater. The king
                    allegedly built the
                    towering gardens to ease his lover Amytis' homesickness for the natural beauty of her home in Media
                    (the northwestern
                    part of modern-day Iran). Later writers described how people could walk underneath the beautiful
                    gardens, which rested
                    on tall stone columns.
